  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <h3>User Research</h3>
  <p>We conducted interviews and surveys to understand the needs of individuals facing food insecurity, as well as the motivations and limitations of local businesses with surplus food.</p>

  <h3>Persona</h3>
  <p>Based on our findings, we created detailed personas representing our primary users â€” including a single parent working late shifts, and a local bakery owner with daily food waste.</p>

  <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
  <p>We mapped out the end-to-end experience of users from discovering the platform to receiving food assistance, identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement.</p>

  <h3>Storyboards</h3>
  <p>For our application, we divided our key features we want to show off in three tasks. Below are rough sketches of storyboards
  of how the user is going to interact with our application based on the task that hey are trying to achieve.</p>

  </div>

  <h3>Design Iteration</h3>
  <p>The first conceptual design layout was created in Canva, and it served as a starting point of how we want our application to
  be laid out. Features in this concept included easy to read tabs and pinpoints on where select food deals may be.</p>

  <p>After presenting this, we got feedback on making a volunteer persona and to have volunteer events from volunteers who signed up
  for our application to be presented in a different pinpoint color to the target user audience. This is where we got inspiration for
  our second task of our storyboard.</p>
