  <h2>Design Process</h2>

  <h3>User Research</h3>
  <p>Since we are college students, we would want to get as much information as possible 
  to ensure we are accounting for everything and emphasize things that could be more important. We also want to try to be in 
  the point of view of the target audience as much as possible. Below is some of the methods we would use to make this possible.</p>
  <p><strong>Surveys</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gather insights from both food businesses and low-income individuals about their needs, preferences, and barriers</li>
      <li>Ask about their food access challenges, smartphone/internet usage, and comfort with digital platforms</li>
      <li>Helps gather insights from a large number of low-income individuals quickly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Design Ethnography</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gain a comprehensive and empathetic understanding of their struggle with this problem</li>
      <li>Captures real-life behaviors and social interactions that may not be revealed in surveys or interviews</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Interviewing</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>15-20 minutes</li>
      <li>Focus on their experiences with food insecurity, tech accessibility, and willingness to use a digital platform for food access</li>
      <li>More one-on-one experience and provides deeper insights than surveying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Online Research</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search up poverty levels in various places to find a trend where we could implement this application</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Persona</h3>
  <p>Based on our findings, we created a detailed persona representing our primary user</p>

  <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
  <p>We mapped out the end-to-end experience of users from discovering the platform to receiving food assistance, identifying points and opportunities for improvement.</p>

  <h3>Storyboards</h3>
  <p>For our application, we divided our key features we want to show off in three tasks. Below are rough sketches of storyboards
  of how the user is going to interact with our application based on the task that hey are trying to achieve.</p>
  <div class="storyboard-row">
    <img src="images/lfs1.png" alt="Low Design1" loading="lazy">
    <img src="images/lfs2.png" alt="Low Design2" loading="lazy">
    <img src="images/lfs3.png" alt="Low Design3" loading="lazy">
  </div>

  <h3>Design Iteration</h3>
  <p>The first conceptual design layout was created in Canva, and it served as a starting point of how we want our application to
  be laid out. Features in this concept included easy to read tabs and pinpoints on where select food deals may be.</p>
  <div class="design-concept">
    <img src="images/concept-mobile.png" alt="Mobile Concept" style="width: 300px;" loading="lazy">
    <img src="images/concpet-web.png" alt="Web Concept" loading="lazy">
  </div>
  <p>After presenting this, we got feedback on making a volunteer persona and to have volunteer events from volunteers who signed up
  for our application to be presented in a different pinpoint color to the target user audience. This is where we got inspiration for
  our second task of our storyboard.</p>
