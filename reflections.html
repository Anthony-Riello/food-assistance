    <h2>Reflections and Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into the HCI design process. Our iterative approach allowed us to improve usability at every step.</p>
    <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> The importance of early user feedback, realistic prototyping, and continuous evaluation.</p>
    <p><strong>What Worked Well:</strong> Clear team communication, use of Figma, and stakeholder involvement.</p>
    <p><strong>Improvements for Next Time:</strong> Begin research earlier and involve more diverse user groups in testing.</p>
    <p>Overall, the final prototype addresses user needs effectively and integrates heuristic feedback for a better user experience.</p>
