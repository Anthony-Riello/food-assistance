    <h1>Welcome to Food Assistance</h1>
    <h3>HCI Project By: Esther Chang and Anthony Riello</h3>
    <p>We were tasked to create a Human Computer Interaction project that is targeted on a specific group or population. 
    Our project aims to address food insecurity by connecting businesses with surplus food to individuals and families in need.
    We made sure our design was intuitive as possible while
    keeping our signature green aesthetic to accomodate users of all levels of experience with technology.
    This was all created and designed in the months of January, February, March, and April of 2025.</p>
