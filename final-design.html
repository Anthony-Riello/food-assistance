  <h2>Final Design</h2>
  <p>Following heuristic evaluations and user feedback, we refined the design to address usability issues and improve visual clarity. Below are the final UI flows, organized by core user tasks.</p>

  <h3>Task 1: Finding a Participating Location</h3>
  <p>The onboarding, home screen, and food-finding experience were polished for clarity and accessibility. Notifications, maps, and listings are now more cohesive and intuitive to navigate.</p>

  <h3>Task 2: Organizing a Community Food-Sharing Event</h3>
  <p>The event creation flow was simplified and better structured for mobile users. Input fields are clear, feedback screens reinforce user confidence, and the experience is streamlined end-to-end.</p>

  <h3>Task 3: Messaging a Food Provider About Availability</h3>
  <p>The messaging UI now features cleaner visual hierarchy, message timestamps, and improved legibility. This supports trust-building communication between users and food providers.</p>
